# MyNotePad

In this project I have tried to create notepad with few standard functionalities.

## Project description

It is an application in which you can write notes and then:
1. save them into .txt files
2. open .txt files
3. copy whole text into clipboard so you can paste it anywhere
4. paste text from clipboard even if it was copied outside the application
Also there is a dialog in which you can change font, style and size of the text and there is an option to change theme to light or dark.

## How to install and Run the project

In "ReadyToExecute" folder there are .jar and .exe files which you can run but you might have to install java on your computer. The newest version you can find here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

### For programmers

I'm using Eclipse IDE for Java Developers. In that case you just have to download this repo, unpack it and import existing project into workspace. Then just hit run button pointing at RunNotePad class and it should launch.

## How to use project

You can use it like typical notepad. There are some options I will describe below:
1.1. File/Open - you can open any .txt file and the text should appear in the text area.
1.2. File/Save - saves text in selected directory with .txt extention.
2.1. Edit/Copy - copies text to clipboard so you can paste it anywhere even outside the project.
2.2. Edit/Paste - pastes text from clipboard into the application even if it was copied outside the application.
3. Format/Font - opens dialog window in which you can edit font, style and size of the button.
4.1. Theme/Light - changes theme to light.
4.2. Theme/Dark - changes theme to dark.
