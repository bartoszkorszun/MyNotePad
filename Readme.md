# MyNotePad

In this project I have tried to recreate notepad and some of its functions.

## Project description

Though this project is not finished yet it has some functions that I've managed to do. For now it is window application with menubar. You can write text as if in standard notepad. Besides that you can save the .txt file in selected directory and open file from the directory. Also you can copy whole text to the clipboard and paste it from clipboard. 

As you can see there are a few more options in the menu such as "format" or "theme" which are not working for now but I'm willing to add functionalities to this functions soon :)

## How to install and Run the project

There is no .exe or .jar file for now so the only way to run the project is to import it to your IDE and run the "RunNotePad" class. Just FYI I'm using Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.

## How to use project

For now you can use it like typical notepad. There are some options already:
1. Open - you can open any .txt file and the text should appear in the text area.
2. Save - saves text in selected directory with .txt extention.
3. Copy - copies text to clipboard so you can paste it anywhere even outside the project.
4. Paste - pastes text from clipboard into the application even if it was copied outside the application.
